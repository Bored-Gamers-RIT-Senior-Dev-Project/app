# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How To Run
To run the app for development...
1. [Make sure that you have Node.JS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. In the app/client directory, run 'npm install'
3. Once the apps have installed, in the same directory, run 'npm run dev'
4. The console should provide a link to the application.
